# 

This API allows access to Cloud Manager programs, pipelines, and environments by an authorized technical account created through the Adobe I/O Console. The base url for this API is https://cloudmanager.adobe.io, e.g. to get the list of programs for an organization, you would make a GET request to https://cloudmanager.adobe.io/api/programs (with the correct set of headers as described below). This swagger file can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdobeDocs/cloudmanager-api-docs/master/swagger-specs/api.yaml.

## Getting Started


```groovy
def apiInstance = new BranchesApi()
def programId = "programId_example" // String | Identifier of the program.
def repositoryId = "repositoryId_example" // String | Identifier of the repository
def xGwImsOrgId = "xGwImsOrgId_example" // String | IMS organization ID that the request is being made under.
def authorization = "authorization_example" // String | Bearer [token] - An access token for the technical account created through integration with Adobe IO
def xApiKey = "xApiKey_example" // String | IMS Client ID (API Key) which is subscribed to consume services on console.adobe.io

apiInstance.getBranches(programId, repositoryId, xGwImsOrgId, authorization, xApiKey)
    {
    // on success
    def result = (BranchList)it
    println result
    
}
    {
    // on failure
    statusCode, message ->
        println "${statusCode} ${message}"
